# PhD_project
This repository collects scripts, workflows, and analysis pipelines developed during my PhD project.  
It covers **microbiota, proteome, and histone PTM analyses**, with both **univariate/multivariate statistics** and **machine learning approaches**.  
The goal is to provide **reproducible workflows** for integrating omics datasets and exploring biological mechanisms.
